This repository contains all of the seperate count files used for DESeq2 and Limma-voom.

The files are split by their subgroups. Only the MYH7-data, also refered to as Diogo-data was split further in its REBL-PAT, AT and HUES7 cell lines.

All of the workflows made are available in the Workflow-repository
